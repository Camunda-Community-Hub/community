# Camunda Community Hub Roadmap

This is our current roadmap for key touch-points throughout the process of creating and building out the Camunda Community Hub. Please keep in mind that these deadlines and priorities are not set in stone, and may change as the project evolves. 
If a critical component of the project is unable to be completed by the end of the quarter it is scheduled, we will update the community via the Camunda forums. 
We will also maintain this roadmap both on a future dedicated Camunda Community Hub landing page, and via the Camunda Community Hub [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub).

### Q1 2021:

* Begin working together with Camunda community extension maintainers to migrate their extensions currently in the [Zeebe repository](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe) into the Camunda Community Hub
* Implement GitHub Actions for automated deployment of new community extension releases to Maven Central
* Introduce new community extension lifecycle labels and classifications
* Create Issue templates for opening a new pull request, submitting an application to become a reviewer, and more
* Implement issue triage and labelling best practices through the use of Probot, Renovate, and Sheilds.io 
* Outline and define new contributor guidelines, maintainer expectations, and reviewer expectations
* Aim for 100% Zeebe community extension migration to the Camunda Community Hub by the end of Q1 2021

### Q2 2021: 

* Begin working with Camunda community extension maintainers to migrate their extensions in the Camunda Platform repository into the Camunda Community hub

### Q3 2021: 

* Begin working with Camunda Community extension maintainers to migrate their extensions in the BPMN.io repository into the Camunda Community Hub

### Q4 2021: 

* Scope, plan, and implement the Camunda Community Hub Governance plan
